abstract = {For intelligent surveillance systems, abnormal event detection automatically analyses surveillance video sequences and detects abnormal objects or unusual human actions at the frame level. Due to the lack of labelled data, most approaches are semi-supervised based on reconstruction or prediction methods. However, these methods may not generalize well to unseen scene contexts. To address this issue, we present a novel self and mutual scene-adaptive matching method for abnormal event detection. In the framework, we propose synergistic pose estimation and object detection, which effectively integrates human pose and object detection information to improve pose estimation accuracy. Then, the poses are resized to reduce the spatial distance between the source and target domains. The improved pose sequences are further fed into a spatio-temporal graph convolutional network to extract the geometric features. Finally, the features are embedded in a clustering layer to classify action types and compute normality scores. The training data is taken from the training part of common video anomaly detection datasets: UCSD PED1 & PED2, CHUK Avenue, and ShanghaiTech Campus. The proposed framework is evaluated on video sequences with unseen scene contexts in the UCSD PED2 and ShanghaiTech Campus datasets. The detection accuracy and efficiency are also evaluated in detail, and the proposed method for abnormal event detection achieves the highest AUC performance, 84.6%, on the ShanghaiTech Campus dataset and relatively high AUC performance, 96.9% and 74.8%, on UCSD PED2 & PED1 datasets. Compared with other state-of-the-art works, the performance analysis and results confirm the robustness and effectiveness of our proposed framework for cross-scene abnormal event detection.}
